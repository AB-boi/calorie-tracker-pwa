# calorie-tracker-pwa
Just an AI coded simple calorie tracker that logs just the calories and your weight.  
It shows you some simple useful graphs.   
It does not track food items.   
It stores data locally in the browser but comes with an 'Export to .csv' option.   
It can be installed as a PWA for mobile devices.  

### Roadmap
- [ ] Dark mode button

- [ ] Add signature footer
